## Introduction to React Hooks

React Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They were introduced in React 16.8 as an addition to React's component system.

### What is a Hook?

A Hook is a special function that lets you hook into React features such as state and lifecycle methods. Hooks can be called from functional components or custom hooks.

### Commonly Used Hooks

- : Adds React state to functional components.
- : Runs effects in function components.
- : Subscribes to React context without introducing nesting.
- : Manages complex state logic.
- and : Optimize performance by memoizing values.

### useState

The Hook allows you to add React state to functional components.

### useEffect

### useContext

The Hook allows you to subscribe to React context without introducing nesting.

### useReducer

The Hook is an alternative to . It's useful when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

### useCallback and useMemo

and are used to optimize performance by memoizing values.

### Summary

React Hooks provide a way to use React features such as state and lifecycle methods in functional components. They are powerful and can help simplify your code and improve performance. By understanding the most commonly used hooks, you can write more efficient and maintainable React applications.
