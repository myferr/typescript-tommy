# Type Declarations in TypeScript

## Introduction

Type declarations in TypeScript allow you to define types for your codebase explicitly. This helps catch errors early in the development process and makes it easier for other developers to understand the structure of your code.

## Basic Types

TypeScript supports several basic data types:

- : Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.

- : Used to represent textual data.

- : Only two values: or .

- and : Represent the absence of any value.

## Array Types

You can define arrays with specific types in TypeScript:

## Tuple Types

Tuples allow you to express an array where the type of a fixed number of elements is known, but need not be the same:

## Enum Types

Enums allow you to define a set of named constants:

## Any Type

The type is useful when you want to work with code that you don't understand or when you are migrating an existing JavaScript codebase.

## Void Type

The type is used for functions that do not return a value:

## Never Type

The type represents values that never occur. Commonly used in function return types for error handling.

## Object Types

TypeScript allows you to create custom types using interfaces or types:

**Interface**

**Type Alias**

## Type Assertions

Type assertions are a way to tell the compiler that you know more about a value than it does:

Or, using the syntax:

## Review

- Understand the basic types in TypeScript (, , , , , , , and ).
- Learn how to define arrays, tuples, enums, and custom object types using interfaces or types.
- Use type assertions to handle values of unknown types.

Practice these concepts by creating your own types and testing them in your TypeScript projects.
