# Type Versus Interface in TypeScript

## Introduction

In TypeScript, both and are used to define types for variables, functions, and objects. While they serve similar purposes, they have distinct differences that determine when to use each one.

## Key Differences

### 1. Syntax

- **Type Aliases**: Use keyword.

- **Interfaces**: Use keyword.

### 2. Extending

- **Type Aliases**: Can be used with intersections () to combine multiple types.

- **Interfaces**: Use the keyword.

### 3. Merging

- **Type Aliases**: Cannot be merged.
- **Interfaces**: Can merge multiple declarations with the same name.

### 4. Declaration Files

- **Type Aliases**: Can be used in any TypeScript file.
- **Interfaces**: Typically used for declaring types in declaration files ().

## Best Practices

- Use when defining object shapes and when merging is desired.
- Use when creating aliases for primitive types, unions, tuples, or more complex type combinations.

## Conclusion

Both and are powerful tools in TypeScript. Understanding their differences and choosing the right one based on your use case will help you write cleaner and more maintainable code.
